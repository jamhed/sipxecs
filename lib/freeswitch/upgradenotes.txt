To update FS to another version

Replace version numbers in various places:
   lib/freeswitch/Makefile.am
      VERSION = 1.0.5
      SVN_RELEASE = 16184  (Revision to build)
   lib/freeswitch/configure.ac
     AC_INIT(freeswitch, 1.0.5, sales@avaya.com)

Update modules.conf and freeswitch.spec as needed
   The modules that are built are defined in freeswitch.spec, so if
a new or changed module arrives in the new FS code, it needs to be added/
removed from the spec.  In addition, the RUN TIME modules.conf file is
generated by sipXconfig, so any change to what is loaded needs to be
made there as well.

These file from sipXconfig define modules.conf:
   sipXconfig/neoconf/etc/freeswitch/modules.conf.xml.vm
   sipXconfig/neoconf/test/org/sipfoundry/sipxconfig/service/freeswitch/modules.conf.test.xml

Build rpm
   cd lib
   make freeswitch    

Install RPM
   sudo rpm -Uvh lib/dist/RPM/sipx-freeswitch*1.0.5-1*

Update the FS config files to what comes with the RPM
   sudo ....bin/freeswitch.sh --config

Tell sipXconfig to regen all config files
   ..../bin/sipxconfig.sh --first-run
